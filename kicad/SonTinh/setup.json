[{"role": "user", "content": "I want to design a pcb board for s Stevenson Screen, it should include sensors for Temperature, Air Humidity, CO2 and NO (NO is the least important). Do you have suggestions for sensors to use?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great project! A Stevenson Screen is a perfect enclosure for high\u2011quality environmental monitoring. Since you want to measure **temperature, humidity, CO\u2082**, and possibly **NO**, you\u2019ll want low\u2011power, accurate sensors that play well together on a PCB.\n\nHere are some suggestions:\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf21\ufe0f Temperature & Humidity\nIt\u2019s common to combine these in one integrated sensor:\n- **Sensirion SHT31 / SHT35**  \n  - Very accurate (\u00b10.3 \u00b0C, \u00b11.5% RH).  \n  - I\u00b2C interface, easy to use.  \n- **Sensirion SHTC3**  \n  - Lower power, smaller, good balance of power/accuracy.  \n- **Bosch BME280 / BME688**  \n  - Measures temperature, humidity, and pressure (and BME688 can sense some gases, though not with quantitative accuracy for CO\u2082).  \n  - Widely supported libraries, cheap.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udec1 CO\u2082 Sensor\nFor CO\u2082 you\u2019ll need an NDIR (non\u2011dispersive infrared) sensor:\n- **Sensirion SCD30**  \n  - Accurate (\u00b130 ppm + 3% of reading).  \n  - I\u00b2C output, measures T/RH as well.  \n- **Sensirion SCD41 / SCD40**  \n  - Smaller, lower power, newer generation.  \n- **Sensair S8**  \n  - Reliable NDIR sensor, UART interface, tried and tested.\n\n> \u26a0\ufe0f Note: NDIR sensors draw more power than simple digital temperature/humidity sensors \u2014 consider your power budget.\n\n---\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f Nitric Oxide (NO)\nGas detection here is trickier. You\u2019ll need an **electrochemical gas sensor**. Options:\n- **Alphasense NO\u2011A4** or similar electrochemical sensors.  \n- These require an analog front\u2011end (AFE) for current measurement, e.g., **TI LMP91000** or an instrumentation amplifier circuit.\n\n> These sensors are usually more expensive, need calibration, and aren\u2019t as plug\u2011and\u2011play as digital sensors. If NO is \u201cless important,\u201d I\u2019d prototype the PCB with a placeholder footprint or connector for an electrochemical module.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Integration Notes\n- Consider using an **I\u00b2C bus** for most (SHT, BME, SCD series are I\u00b2C).  \n- If you need multiple I\u00b2C devices with the same address, you may need an I\u00b2C multiplexer (e.g., **TCA9548A**).  \n- Place the CO\u2082 sensor where it has airflow \u2014 in a Stevenson Screen that\u2019s usually fine, but avoid heat sources (like voltage regulators) too close.\n- Provide ESD and surge protection on sensor lines if deployed outdoors.\n- Think about **calibration & baseline drift** \u2014 especially for CO\u2082 and NO.\n- If powered by battery/solar, check CO\u2082 sensor power draw (SCD30 can be ~19 mA average, SCD41 much lower).\n\n---\n\n\u2705 **Recommended minimal set:**  \n- **SHT35** (Temp/RH) + **SCD41** (CO\u2082).  \n- Optional: electrochemical NO sensor with analog front\u2011end, if the budget allows.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to also suggest a **microcontroller family** that pairs well with these (low\u2011power, multiple I\u00b2C handles, optional wireless for data logging)?"}]
