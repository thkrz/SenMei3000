Design a modern and innovative logo for a geoscience soil monitoring station.
The logo should incorporate elements symbolizing soil, nature, and technology.
Use earthy colors like brown, green, and blue. Include graphical
representations of soil layers, plant roots, and monitoring equipment such as
sensors or data graphs. The design should convey a sense of scientific
research, environmental stewardship, and should be simple enough for easy
recognition. Incorporate the japanese God Ryujin into it.
